With the extension "users" you get all necessary plugins to build up a community or a protected user area without complicated TYPOSCRIPT. All essential adjustments are made comfortably directly in the plugins. The adaptation is easily done via FLUID templates and is already based on Bootstrap 4. The "users" extension is maintained regularly, errors are fixed within a few days and new functions are added regularly.

# Features of the "users" Extension

## General

* User friendly, no complicated typoscript: You can configure all settings via the plugins
* FLUID templates, based on bootstrap 4, easy to customize. Even for emails.
* Security:
    * google Captcha V2 support (for new user registrations)
    * According to https://typo3.org/security/advisory/typo3-psa-2019-002/, Username and Email Address Enumeration is not possible in all plugins. If a user registers with an email, that exists, the email adress automatically gets a remember mail with an password reset link. (Thanks to Vasyl from http://typo3.net.ua/)
    * Ban hostnames for registration
    * A list of thousands of disposable email address providers is included and can be imported with one click.
    * Ban email adresses for registration
* Helpful multi Site support:
     * Saves root page uid for every registered user
     * Saves language setting of every user (on registration and every login, configurable)
* Language files delivered: 
    * German
    * English
    * Ukrainian
    
Offical support (fee-based) via https://filmmusic.io/imprint/

# Planned / ToDo

Here you can see what we are currently working on and what is still planned:
https://github.com/saschaende/typo3-users/projects
    
# Important notes

* Very important: Do NOT activate "Also allow login with email adress" in the "[Users] Login" plugin, if your system allows usernames with email adresses. The register plugin of this users extension will not allow email adresses as usernames.
* This extension does not allow multiple accounts with the same email address. It is also not planned to allow this.
* To display the icons in the forms, you need "fontawesome" - get it here: https://fontawesome.com/start
    * If you dont want fontawesome, you can configure the icon classes in TYPOSCRIPT and set "iconsInTheForms" to 0 or 1    

# Installation

## Preparation: Include static TypoScript
The extension ships some TypoScript code which needs to be included.

* Switch to the root page of your site.
* Switch to the Template module and select Info/Modify.
* Press the link Edit the whole template record and switch to the tab Includes.
* Select "Users (users)" at the field Include static (from extensions)
* If you have multiple websites configured, repeat the steps above for every website

## General

* Click on "add content element"
* Switch to the tab "Users"
* Choose a plugin (login, register, ...) and insert it

![1](Documentation/overview_plugins.JPG)

* Edit the plugin (pencil)
* Edit the settings in the "plugin" tab (see the screenshots here in the documentation)
* Thats it and that's how every "users" plugin works
* No further typoscript

# Add plugins and configure your community

## Publicly accessible plugins

### Plugin: Login

Here users log in with their access data. Normally the username or the e-mail address and the password are used. The plugin supports login with username AND e-mail. For this reason, no e-mail addresses are allowed as user names.

* Add a new page "Login"
* **The page must be publicly accessible.**
* Insert plugin "[Users] Login"
* Click on the pencil icon
* Edit plugin settings

### Plugin: Forgot password

If a user has forgotten his password, he can request an e-mail with a link here using his user name or e-mail address. Afterwards, the user can assign a new password by clicking on the e-mail. If the account has not yet been activated, this action will automatically activate it.

* Add a new page "Forgot password"
* **The page must be publicly accessible.**
* Insert plugin "[Users] Login"
* Click on the pencil icon
* Edit plugin settings

### Plugin: Register

Here a user can register and create an account. The email address is automatically matched against a database of spam hosts. If the user enters an e-mail address that already exists, he will receive a link to assign a new password, as we can assume that the user has forgotten this.

* Add a new page "Register now"
* **The page must be publicly accessible.**
* Insert plugin "[Users] Register"
* Click on the pencil icon
* Edit plugin settings

As an option the plugin can be configured to make an additional registration review mandatory:

- approval email will to be send to admins 
- approval email has links "activate" and "reject"
- "reject" will send an email to user "sorry rejected"
- "activate" will send an email to user "you're accepted" with a link to login page
